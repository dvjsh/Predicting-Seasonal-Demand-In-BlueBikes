# Predicting-Seasonal-Demand-In-BlueBikes
Bluebikes is a bike-sharing company that is in and around Boston, Massachusetts. The company provides affordable and accessible public transportation while also promoting a healthy alternative to quickly travel around the city. Recently, Bluebikes was sponsored by Blue Cross Blue Shield to support their initiatives and to help increase the accessibility to healthcare facilities (“Blue Cross Blue Shield”).
The focus of this project was on three main business topics:
1. Seasonality impact and trends in bike share demand 
2. Gap between the availability of dock stations and the demand of riders 
3. Install more docks at more popular locations or reduce them in places where there is little demand 

These topics were chosen so that our group would be able to look at trends in demand and how weather and other factors can impact the usage of Bluebikes. Also, our group wanted to find the most popular dock stations and use the analysis to make recommendations on how to improve upon their operational expansion.

We have used 3 datasets - Trip History, Dock Stations and Weather. In our analysis, the level of data granularity is fine.
1. Bluebikes system trip history data from 2019 to 2022 from Bluebikes website (https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data) (“Bluebikes System Data.”)
2. Bluebikes current dock station locations from Bluebikes website (https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data) (“Bluebikes System Data.”)
3. Historical weather data in Boston from the National Weather Service(https://www.weather.gov/wrh/climate?wfo=box) (“NOAA's National Weather Service”)
